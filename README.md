# Datathon-2025

This was our submission to the 2025 Virginia Datathon: https://youtu.be/_cjPwy2hfNo

Team Backseat Analysts focused on using crash data to identify Virginia's most dangerous roads and conditions contributing 
to fatal accidents. With over 1.2 million crash records from 2016 to 2025, they mapped high-fatality zones across the state, 
including interstates and urban areas like Richmond and Virginia Beach. They incorporated pedestrian data to highlight risky 
intersections and created an interactive dashboard to visualize crash data and trends. Their team also developed a deep 
learning model to predict crash severity, helping prioritize emergency response and infrastructure planning. Despite 
challenges with data imbalances, their model demonstrated potential for improving road safety and supporting real-time 
alerts for risky areas.
